CrudRepository 
	interface provides generic CRUD operations on a repository for a specific type.
 	Its findById() method retrieves an entity by its id. The return value is Optional<T>.

Optional<T> 
	is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value.
 	If a value is present, isPresent() returns true and get() returns the value.
 	The ifPresent() invokes the specified method if the value is present; otherwise nothing is done.

BeanUtils 
	class provides a copyProperties method that copies the properties of source object to target object
 where the property name is same in both objects
